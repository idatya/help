MySQL is installed with a basic configuration meant for development and testing purposes. However, the configuration is not secure for production enviroments, therefore it comes with a utility to handle basic security. Run the following command and answer the questions based on your environment requirements.

sudo mysql_secure_installation
Creating MySQL Users

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create a non-root user, connect to the MySQL instance with the mysql command line client.

mysql -u root -p
Now use the CREATE USER command to generate a new user. Make sure to change "mynewuser" and "goodPassword" with your own values.

CREATE USER 'mynewuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'goodPassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'mynewuser'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

How to set up MySQL for remote access

Step one: Allowing access
Out of the box, MySQL will only allow access from the localhost address 127.0.0.1. To change this, you need to open the /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf file and change the line:

bind-address = 127.0.0.1
to:
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
Save and close that file. Restart the MySQL server with the command:

systemctl restart mysql.service

Step two: Granting access to the user
Log in to the MySQL server.
Log in to MySQL with the command mysql -u root -p
Type the MySQL root user password.
Issue the MySQL command:
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.100' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Or
GRANT ALL ON specificDatabase.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.100' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Flush the MySQL privileges with the command FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit out of the MySQL prompt with the command exit;

[Problem]Host 'xxx.xx.xxx.xxx' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
[Solution]
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
