Step 1 - Perform MySQL Dump
You can dump all your MySQL databases to a single file using this:

	mysqldump -u root –p –all-databases > [dump_file.sql]

or if you want to dump a single database, you can use:

	mysqldump -u root –p [database_name] > [dump_file.sql]

[database_name]: The name of the database you want to take backup.
[dump_file.sql]: The name of the dump file you want to generate.

If the database you’re transferring is running or in use, you can stop the mysql using the systemctl command as shown:

	systemctl stop mysql

After the dump is performed, you can now transfer the database to the new server.

Step 2 – Transfer the MySQL Database Dump File to the New Server
In this step, we are using the SCP command to transfer the database dump file to the new server.

	scp [database name].sql [username]@[servername]:[database path]

Step 3 - Import the Database
Once the MySQL dump file has been transferred to the new server, you can import the database into MySQL:

	mysql -u root -p [name of new database] < /path/to/newdatabase.sql

Step 4 – Verify the Database Imported
Once the import is completed, you can verify the databases on both servers on the mysql shell using these commands:

	mysql -u user -p
	show databases;
